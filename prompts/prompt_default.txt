# Pharmaceutical Competitive Landscape Analysis Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for conducting competitive landscape analyses in pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, focusing on specific targets, mechanisms of action (MoA), or therapeutic indications.

## Section 1: Analysis for Specific Target or MoA

### 1. Literature Review Search Strategy

**Search Parameters:**

- Primary search: "[Target Name]" AND "Review"
- Time frame: Last 3-5 years only
- Focus: Review articles exclusively (exclude primary research papers)

**Exclusion Criteria:**

- Reviews authored by researchers from Iranian or Indian academic institutions or medical centers
- Primary research papers (due to potential retraction risks at this stage)

### 2. Competitive Landscape Development

**Essential Data Points:**

- **INN** (International Nonproprietary Name)
- **Brand names/Development codes** (multiple possible due to licensing - search all variants)
- **Developer(s)/Company(ies)**
- **Target specificity** (verify detailed subtypes)
- **Indications** (approved and in development)
- **Combination therapies** (specify combination drugs by indication)
- **Industry collaborators** (by indication)
- **Dosing and regimen**
- **Latest development stage** (by indication)
- **Patent information**

**Class-Specific Factors for Differentiation Analysis:**

- Efficacy parameters
- Safety profile and toxicity data
- Production specifications (host systems, manufacturing processes)
- Formulation details
- Dosing and administration regimen

### 3. Reference Sources

**Approved Drugs:**

- FDA Database: [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm)
- EMA Database: [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines)

**Clinical Development:**

- ClinicalTrials.gov
- WHO International Clinical Trials Registry: trialsearch.who.int

**Patent Research:**

- KIPRIS (Korea): [https://www.kipris.or.kr/khome/main.do](https://www.kipris.or.kr/khome/main.do)
    - Search parameters:
        - Applicant: Development companies
        - Inventors: Executive team, Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Technical/Science executives
        - University Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) associated with SAB members
        - Claims analysis

**Additional Sources:**

- Company websites
- Google search (beyond news articles)
- Maximum 20 pages of Google results (extend to 40 pages if initial results are limited)

## Section 2: Analysis for Specific Therapeutic Indication

### 1. Initial Literature Review

(Follow same search strategy as Section 1.1)

### 2. Approved Therapeutics Competitive Landscape

**Priority Focus:** Begin with FDA/EMA approved drugs and therapies

**Data Collection:** (Follow same essential data points and class-specific factors as Section 1.2)

### 3. Pipeline Therapeutics Competitive Landscape

**Development Stage Analysis:**

- Include all clinical development stages
- Track both monotherapy and combination approaches
- Monitor licensing and collaboration changes

**Special Considerations for Combination Therapies:**

- When combination includes approved drugs: Cross-reference with FDA/EMA databases
- Verify all partner drug information
- Document indication-specific combinations

### 4. Comprehensive Source Verification

(Use all reference sources listed in Section 1.3)
